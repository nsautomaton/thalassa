{"name":"Thalassa","tagline":"","body":"**!!CAVEAT!!**-_**this is a work in progress!**_\r\n### What exactly is this?\r\nThalassa is a lightweight implementation of the [WAMP V2 protocol](http://wamp.ws/), written in php.\r\n\r\n### !What is\r\nThalassa is not a web-socket server.Although it is built upon web-sockets and fully implements the web-socket protocol, specifically [RFC6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455).Support for older protocols may be added.\r\nThalassa will only work for clients implementing WAMP as a websocket sub-protocol, and hence is better defined as a WAMP\r\nserver, as opposed to a _WAMP-capable_ websocket server.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThalassa features an event-driven IO using [libevent](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.libevent.php), and implements the role of a router and a dealer.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nA working installation of the [libevent library](http://libevent.org/) and [necessary extensions](http://pecl.php.net/package/libevent).\r\n \r\n### Installing\r\nComposer:\r\n`\"require\": {`\r\n\t    `\"nsautomaton/thalassa\": \"dev-master\"`\r\n           `}`\r\n\r\n***\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
